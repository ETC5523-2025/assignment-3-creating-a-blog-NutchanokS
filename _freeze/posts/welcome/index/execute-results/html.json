Tracking how nitrate changes through time is therefore crucial for protecting aquatic ecosystems and managing water quality.\n\nMonitoring, however, remains a costly challenge.\n\nHigh-frequency sensors now collect millions of readings each day on affordable variables such as water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity. But the devices capable of directly measuring nitrate are costly and delicate, meaning only a few can be installed across large river systems. Others rely on manual water sampling, which is slow and often misses short-term fluctuations.\n\nEven with these data, a deeper challenge remains: *the link between nitrate and other water-quality variables is rarely straightforward.* Rivers behave non-linearly, a small change in temperature or conductivity may have very different effects depending on season, flow, or land use. Traditional linear models struggle to capture this complexity.\n\nThat’s why researchers have begun asking a new question: \n\n> *Can we use the data from cheaper sensors, combined with advanced models, to understand nitrate without relying on costly instruments?*\n\n## Understanding Nitrate Through Smart Data\n\n### Uncovering Nitrate Patterns from High-Frequency Data\n\nBuilding on that question, the study by [Kermorvant et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287640) provides a powerful real-world test of whether cheaper sensor data can indeed reveal how nitrate behaves in rivers.\n\nTo investigate this, the researchers analysed high-frequency water-quality records from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), a U.S. program that publishes open, standardised environmental data.\n\nNEON’s in-situ sensors collect readings every 15 minutes, creating detailed time-series data that capture how rivers change through seasons, storm events, and daily cycles.\n\nFor this analysis, the researchers focused on three ecologically distinct watersheds: the **Arikaree River** in semi-arid Colorado, **Caribou Creek** in subarctic Alaska, and **Lewis Run** in temperate Virginia (@fig-map). Together, these sites offered over 70,000 time-stamped measurements collected between 2018 and 2019, spanning wide environmental gradients from frozen tundra to warm agricultural plains.\n\n::: {#fig-map}\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"leaflet html-widget html-fill-item\" id=\"htmlwidget-d20fc6bd42907c9aaa7f\" style=\"width:100%;height:464px;\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-d20fc6bd42907c9aaa7f\">{\"x\":{\"options\":{\"crs\":{\"crsClass\":\"L.CRS.EPSG3857\",\"code\":null,\"proj4def\":null,\"projectedBounds\":null,\"options\":{}}},\"calls\":[{\"method\":\"addTiles\",\"args\":[\"https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png\",null,null,{\"minZoom\":0,\"maxZoom\":18,\"tileSize\":256,\"subdomains\":\"abc\",\"errorTileUrl\":\"\",\"tms\":false,\"noWrap\":false,\"zoomOffset\":0,\"zoomReverse\":false,\"opacity\":1,\"zIndex\":1,\"detectRetina\":false,\"attribution\":\"&copy; <a href=\\\"https://openstreetmap.org/copyright/\\\">OpenStreetMap<\\/a>,  <a href=\\\"https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/\\\">ODbL<\\/a>\"}]},{\"method\":\"addCircleMarkers\",\"args\":[[39.758206,65.15322399999999,39.095637],[-102.44715,-147.50397,-77.983216],6,null,null,{\"interactive\":true,\"className\":\"\",\"stroke\":true,\"color\":\"#006DAE\",\"weight\":5,\"opacity\":0.5,\"fill\":true,\"fillColor\":\"#006DAE\",\"fillOpacity\":0.9},null,null,[\"Arikaree River (Colorado)\",\"Caribou Creek (Alaska)\",\"Lewis Run (Virginia)\"],null,[\"Arikaree River (Colorado)\",\"Caribou Creek (Alaska)\",\"Lewis Run (Virginia)\"],{\"interactive\":false,\"permanent\":false,\"direction\":\"auto\",\"opacity\":1,\"offset\":[0,0],\"textsize\":\"10px\",\"textOnly\":false,\"className\":\"\",\"sticky\":true},null]},{\"method\":\"addProviderTiles\",\"args\":[\"CartoDB.Positron\",null,null,{\"errorTileUrl\":\"\",\"noWrap\":false,\"detectRetina\":false}]},{\"method\":\"addLegend\",\"args\":[{\"colors\":[\"#006DAE\"],\"labels\":[\"Study Sites\"],\"na_color\":null,\"na_label\":\"NA\",\"opacity\":0.5,\"position\":\"bottomright\",\"type\":\"unknown\",\"title\":\"NEON Sensor Locations\",\"extra\":null,\"layerId\":null,\"className\":\"info legend\",\"group\":null}]}],\"limits\":{\"lat\":[39.095637,65.15322399999999],\"lng\":[-147.50397,-77.983216]}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\nMap showing the three NEON study sites across the United States from the study by Kermorvant et al. (2023).\n:::\n\nEach site continuously measured water temperature, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, specific conductance, and surface-water elevation, while nitrate levels were monitored using a smaller number of costly, specialised sensors.\n\nThese rich, real-time datasets provided the foundation to test whether advanced modelling could capture nitrate dynamics without relying solely on expensive nitrate instrumentation.\n\n### Capturing Rapid Change in Rivers\n\nHigh-frequency data reveal short-term river fluctuations that traditional grab-sampling often misses.\n\nAs shown in @fig-diel, the upper panels display daily cycles in temperature, oxygen, and other variables, showing rivers “breathe” through natural light and photosynthesis patterns.\nThe lower panels show storm or flow events, with sharp spikes in turbidity or water level as runoff enters the system.\n\nSuch fine-grained temporal resolution demonstrates why continuous monitoring with cheaper sensors is so powerful — it captures the fast processes that shape nitrate concentration but are invisible in sparse, manual sampling. However, to interpret these complex, non-linear dynamics, a flexible modelling approach is essential.\n\n![High-frequency time-series for the three NEON sites, showing daily cycles and short-term flow events in water-quality variables.

(2023, Figure 2).](fig2.png){#fig-diel fig-align=\"center\" width=80% fig-pos=\"H\"}\n\nThese examples set the stage for the modelling work that follows, showing how dynamic river systems require equally flexible analytical tools.\n\n### Modelling Relationships Beyond Straight Lines\n\nTo make sense of these dynamic signals, the researchers used Generalised Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs), a flexible statistical method capable of describing non-linear patterns and time dependence in water-quality data.\n\nEach model used six predictor variables from low-cost sensors:\n\n- specific conductance\n- dissolved oxygen\n- temperature\n- turbidity (log-transformed)\n- surface-water elevation\n- time (to capture seasonal cycles).\n\nGAMMs fit smooth curves instead of straight lines, allowing the model to learn relationships that shift under different conditions.\n\nFor example, nitrate may rise with temperature up to a threshold, then fall as biological uptake increases which are patterns that linear models would miss.\n\nAs illustrated in @fig-gamm, these smooth relationships differ between sites: nitrate rose with conductivity at Lewis Run, indicating nutrient-rich runoff, while at Caribou Creek, temperature showed a thaw-related seasonal pulse.\n\nThis diversity confirms that real rivers don’t behave linearly, reinforcing the need for flexible models like GAMMs to uncover how cheap sensor data relate to nitrate.\n\n![Smooth relationships between nitrate concentration and key water-quality variables across the three NEON study sites, showing non-linear patterns captured by the GAMM model.

Source: Kermorvant et al. (2023, Figure 1).](fig1.png){#fig-box fig-align=\"center\" width=70% fig-pos=\"H\"}\n\nThese contrasts highlight how flexible models can uncover unique “river stories” even when the same variables are used.\n\n### Which Factors Matter Most?\n\nFinally, the researchers examined which variables contributed most to explaining nitrate variation (@fig-importance).\n\nAcross all rivers, conductivity and temperature were the strongest predictors, both measured by inexpensive and reliable sensors.\n\n![Relative importance of each water-quality variable in explaining nitrate concentration across the three NEON study sites.

(2023, Figure 4).](fig4.png){#fig-importance fig-align=\"center\" width=70% fig-pos=\"H\"}\n\nAt **Lewis Run**, conductivity and turbidity dominated, consistent with nutrient-rich urban runoff.</br>\nAt **Caribou Creek**, temperature and surface elevation were strongest, reflecting thaw-driven nutrient pulses.</br>\nAt **Arikaree River**, smaller but consistent effects pointed to biological uptake in its dry environment.\n\nTogether, these results show that the same inexpensive sensors can reveal key nitrate drivers across diverse climates, proving that cheaper monitoring doesn’t mean weaker science.\n\n### Back to the Question\n\nSo, can we really understand nitrate using only cheaper sensors?</br>\nThe findings from [Kermorvant et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287640) provide a clear answer:\n\n> Yes — data from cheaper, routinely measured sensors, when paired with advanced models, can accurately describe nitrate dynamics across diverse environments.\n\nBy capturing nearly 99% of nitrate variation without relying on costly instruments, this study demonstrates that data science can make water monitoring both smarter and more affordable.\n\nIt closes the gap between costly precision and practical sustainability — a step toward cleaner, well-managed rivers supported by intelligent use of the data we already collect.\n\n### Smarter Data for Sustainable Rivers\n\nThe findings from [Kermorvant et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287640) show that smart use of affordable sensor data can unlock a deeper understanding of water-quality dynamics.\n\nBy combining routinely measured variables such as conductivity, temperature, and turbidity with advanced statistical models, the researchers explained nearly all variation in nitrate concentration across three very different river systems.\n\nThis breakthrough extends far beyond the study sites. It proves that environmental managers no longer need to depend solely on expensive instruments to monitor nitrate. With data-science tools like GAMMs, existing sensor networks can provide the same insights at a fraction of the cost.\n\nUltimately, this approach bridges the gap between data availability and environmental action, showing that innovation in analytical methods, not just new technology, can make water monitoring more sustainable.\n\n> Rather than replacing sensors, data science ensures that every reading counts.\n\n## Reference\n\nKermorvant, C., Liquet, B., Litt, G., Mengersen, K., Peterson, E.
