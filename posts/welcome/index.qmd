## The Hidden Cost of Measuring Nitrate

Nitrate is essential for life but in excess, it becomes toxic to rivers and streams. 

When concentrations rise, it fuels algal blooms that strip oxygen from the water, suffocating fish and other aquatic animals. Tracking how nitrate changes through time is therefore crucial for protecting aquatic ecosystems and managing water quality.

Monitoring, however, remains a costly challenge.

High-frequency sensors now collect millions of readings each day on affordable variables such as water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity. But the devices capable of directly measuring nitrate are costly and delicate, meaning only a few can be installed across large river systems. Others rely on manual water sampling, which is slow and often misses short-term fluctuations.

Even with these data, a deeper challenge remains: **the link between nitrate and other water-quality variables is rarely straightforward.** Rivers behave non-linearly, a small change in temperature or conductivity may have very different effects depending on season, flow, or land use. Traditional linear models struggle to capture this complexity.

That’s why researchers have begun asking a new question: 

> *Can we use the data from cheaper sensors, combined with advanced models, to understand nitrate without relying on costly instruments?*

## Understanding Nitrate Through Smart Data

### Uncovering Nitrate Patterns from High-Frequency Data

Building on that question, the study by [Kermorvant et al. (2023)](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://research-management.mq.edu.au/ws/portalfiles/portal/296641846/journal.pone.0287640.pdf) provides a powerful real-world test of whether cheaper sensor data can indeed reveal how nitrate behaves in rivers.

To investigate this, the researchers analysed high-frequency water-quality records from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), a U.S. program that publishes open, standardised environmental data.

NEON’s in-situ sensors collect readings every 15 minutes, creating detailed time-series data that capture how rivers change through seasons, storm events, and daily cycles.

For this analysis, the researchers focused on three ecologically distinct watersheds: the **Arikaree River** in semi-arid Colorado, **Caribou Creek** in subarctic Alaska, and **Lewis Run** in temperate Virginia (@fig-map). Together, these sites offered over 70,000 time-stamped measurements collected between 2018 and 2019, spanning wide environmental gradients from frozen tundra to warm agricultural plains.

Each site continuously measured water temperature, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, specific conductance, and surface-water elevation, while nitrate levels were monitored using a smaller number of costly, specialised sensors.

These rich, real-time datasets provided the foundation to test whether advanced modelling could capture nitrate dynamics without relying solely on expensive nitrate instrumentation.

### Capturing Rapid Change in Rivers

High-frequency data reveal short-term river fluctuations that traditional grab-sampling often misses.

As shown in @fig-diel, the upper panels display daily cycles in temperature, oxygen, and other variables, showing rivers “breathe” through natural light and photosynthesis patterns.
The lower panels show storm or flow events, with sharp spikes in turbidity or water level as runoff enters the system.

Such fine-grained temporal resolution demonstrates why continuous monitoring with cheaper sensors is so powerful — it captures the fast processes that shape nitrate concentration but are invisible in sparse, manual sampling. However, to interpret these complex, non-linear dynamics, a flexible modelling approach is essential.

### Modelling Relationships Beyond Straight Lines

To make sense of these dynamic signals, the researchers used Generalised Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs), a flexible statistical method capable of describing non-linear patterns and time dependence in water-quality data.

Each model used six predictor variables from low-cost sensors:

- specific conductance
- dissolved oxygen
- temperature
- turbidity (log-transformed)
- surface-water elevation
- time (to capture seasonal cycles).

GAMMs fit smooth curves instead of straight lines, allowing the model to learn relationships that shift under different conditions.

For example, nitrate may rise with temperature up to a threshold, then fall as biological uptake increases which are patterns that linear models would miss.

As illustrated in @fig-gamm, these smooth relationships differ between sites: nitrate rose with conductivity at Lewis Run, indicating nutrient-rich runoff, while at Caribou Creek, temperature showed a thaw-related seasonal pulse.

This diversity confirms that real rivers don’t behave linearly, reinforcing the need for flexible models like GAMMs to uncover how cheap sensor data relate to nitrate.

### What the Models Revealed

Across all sites, the GAMM explained around 99% of nitrate variation, far exceeding the 75–85% captured by simpler Generalised Additive Models (GAMs) that lacked the mixed-model time component (Kermorvant et al., 2023).

This shows that even with only inexpensive sensor data, advanced models can reconstruct nearly all the behavior of nitrate observed by costly instruments (@tbl-sites).

These results confirm that affordable, high-frequency data can explain nitrate dynamics with exceptional precision which directly addressing the question posed in the problem description.

### Contrasting River Stories

Although the same modelling approach worked across all three rivers, the nitrate patterns differed markedly by site (@fig-box).

**Lewis Run**, an urban–agricultural stream, showed the highest and most variable nitrate and conductivity levels, reflecting runoff and wastewater influences.</br>
**Caribou Creek**, a protected subarctic watershed, remained low and stable across all variables.</br>
**Arikaree River**, in a semi-arid landscape, exhibited strong temperature swings and intermittent flow, producing modest but distinct nitrate peaks after rainfall.

### Which Factors Matter Most?

Finally, the researchers examined which variables contributed most to explaining nitrate variation (@fig-importance).

Across all rivers, conductivity and temperature were the strongest predictors, both measured by inexpensive and reliable sensors.

![Relative importance of each water-quality variable in explaining nitrate concentration across the three NEON study sites. Source: Kermorvant et al. (2023, Figure 4).](fig4.png){#fig-importance fig-align="center" width=70% fig-pos="H"}

At **Lewis Run**, conductivity and turbidity dominated, consistent with nutrient-rich urban runoff.</br>
At **Caribou Creek**, temperature and surface elevation were strongest, reflecting thaw-driven nutrient pulses.</br>
At **Arikaree River**, smaller but consistent effects pointed to biological uptake in its dry environment.

Together, these results show that the same inexpensive sensors can reveal key nitrate drivers across diverse climates, proving that cheaper monitoring doesn’t mean weaker science.

### Back to the Question

The findings from [Kermorvant et al. (2023)](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://research-management.mq.edu.au/ws/portalfiles/portal/296641846/journal.pone.0287640.pdf) provide a clear answer to the question posed earlier:

> Yes, data from cheaper, routinely measured sensors, when paired with advanced models, can accurately describe nitrate dynamics across diverse environments.

By capturing nearly 99% of nitrate variation without relying on costly instruments, this study demonstrates that data science can make water monitoring both smarter and more affordable.

It closes the gap between costly precision and practical sustainability — a step toward cleaner, well-managed rivers supported by intelligent use of the data we already collect.
