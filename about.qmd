**Hi there!ðŸ‘‹** 
</span>

I am a Master of Business Analytics student at Monash University, building on a strong foundation in accounting and finance. I hold a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Accounting from Thammasat University, where I graduated with first-class honours.

Before pursuing postgraduate study, I worked in auditing and accounting roles within the manufacturing and oil & gas industries. These experiences strengthened my analytical and problem-solving skills and sparked my interest in using data-driven insights to improve business performance.

Now, Iâ€™m passionate about combining my accounting background with modern analytics tools to turn data into actionable strategies that drive better decisions and sustainable business value.
